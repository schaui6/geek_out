#Technical Interview Questions
## What is object orient program and why is it important?
-allows us to think of our code as like the real world
-conceptalizes relationships with Objects
-based on relationships create methods
# What is inheritance?
-base class mammal
-resusublity is a benefit
- don't have to write other common mammal methods
- abstraction
- The key is writing code in a way someone else can come in to easily Understand

## Differences interperated vs compiled
- compled is faster because is low level
- complilors have time to make optimization
- interperated is slower because it is high level, so i takes more work.
